# Poker

# Today we will be using TDD to write a poker game, specifically five card draw.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-card_draw


# Learning Goals

# Be able to define desired functionality, write specs, and then implement
# Know how to follow red, green, refactor TDD workflow
# Know how to create and use test doubles
# Know when to use context and describe
# You'll want to use betterspecs as a cheatsheet/reference.
# https://www.betterspecs.org/
# You'll also want to refer to the reading on 
# test doubles for help creating unit tests.

# Rules

# Each player is dealt five cards.
# Players bet; each player may fold, see the current bet, or raise.
# In turn, each player can choose to discard up to three cards.
# They are dealt new cards from the deck to replace their old cards.
# Players bet again.
# If any players do not fold, 
# then players reveal their hands; 
# strongest hand wins the pot.
